# AdventOfRust2020
Solving [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) problems in Rust! I've also put some comments about each exercise and learning Rust at the beginning of each file.

## Running Exercises
To run a specific exercise, run `cargo run --example <ex_name>`.
For example, to run Day 1 Part 1: `cargo run --example day1_pt1`.

## Thank You!
I'd like to give a big thank you to Will Owens [@wsowens](https://github.com/wsowens) for getting me excited about learning Rust and for teaching 
me some really cool tricks in both the language and for displaying information on the terminal!
